# DeezerKodi
This is an unofficial Deezer addon for Kodi.  
It works **only for premium account** (Deezer doesn't allow streaming from free accounts).
It supports access to your playlists, albums, artists and tracks. Searching for tracks, albums and artists is also implemented.
It does not allow for browsing the chart and radio at the moment but it may be implemented in the future.
It plays the .mp3 tracks in 128kb resolution only as that's the max available bitrate for TV's from Deezer.


# Installation
To install the addon, download the [latest release zip file](plugin.audio.deezerkodi/plugin.audio.deezerkodi-0.0.4.zip) located at `plugin.audio.deezerkodi/plugin.audio.deezer-x.y.z.zip`.
Move it to your kodi box the way you want, then install it by selecting `'Install from zip file'` in the addon menu.  
And that's all, it should be updated automatically on every release.

###### Note:
If you previously installed hubatek94's DeezerKodi addon, you sould uninstall it first.

### Compatibility
This addon should be compatible with every version of kodi across devices. However it has been tested only on ubuntu 18.04.
Feel free to let me know if one version/OS or another is working or not.  
Also note that this addon is designed for kodi v17 Krypton and later.
