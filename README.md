# DeezerKodi
This is an unofficial Deezer addon for Kodi.  
It works **only for premium account** (Deezer doesn't allow streaming from free accounts).
Right now this addon works only for family accounts, personal accounts support will be added soon.
It supports access to your playlists. Searching for albums and artists is also implemented.
Searching for tracks will be implemented soon.  
It does not allow for browsing the chart and radio at the moment but it may be implemented in the future.
It plays the .mp3 tracks in 128kb resolution only as that's the max available bitrate for TV's from Deezer.


# Installation
* Download the [latest release zip file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valentin271/DeezerKodi/master/plugin.audio.deezer/plugin.audio.deezer-0.0.5.zip) located at `plugin.audio.deezer/plugin.audio.deezer-x.y.z.zip`.
* Move it to your kodi box.
* Install it by selecting `'Install from zip file'` in the addon menu.

And that's all, it should be updated automatically on every release.

##### Note:
If you previously installed kubatek94's DeezerKodi addon, you should uninstall it first.

### Compatibility
This addon should be compatible with every version of kodi across devices. However it has been tested only on ubuntu 18.04.
Feel free to let me know if one version/OS or another is working or not.  
Also note that this addon is designed for kodi v17 Krypton and later.

# Limitations
Although the addon is working for basic usage, you can't listen to your uploaded music.  
Also, since Deezer API doesn't give profiles for family accounts, the workaround include asking for followings of the main account.
So if you follow anyone on Deezer, they will appear on your family profiles.
