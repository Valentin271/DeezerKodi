# DeezerKodi
This is an unofficial Deezer addon for Kodi.  
It works **only for premium account** (Deezer API doesn't allow streaming for free accounts).
This addon works for personal and family accounts (profiles are usable).  
It supports access to your playlists. Searching for tracks, albums and artists is also implemented.
Let me know if there is a particular feature you want to see implemented.  
Tracks are played in 128kb resolution as that's the max available bitrate for TVs from Deezer.


# Installation
* Download the [latest release zip file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valentin271/DeezerKodi/master/plugin.audio.deezer/plugin.audio.deezer-0.1.2.zip) located at `plugin.audio.deezer/plugin.audio.deezer-x.y.z.zip`.
* Move it to your kodi box.
* Install it by selecting `'Install from zip file'` in the addon menu.

And that's all, it should be updated automatically on every release.

##### Note:
If you previously installed kubatek94's DeezerKodi addon, you should uninstall it first.

### Compatibility
This addon has been tested with Kodi "Leia" 18 and Kodi "Matrix" 19.
Tests where done on Ubuntu, but the addon should work on every device.  
If you have any compatibility issue, please refer to the Issues section.


# Limitations
Since Deezer API doesn't give profiles for family accounts, the workaround include asking for followings of the main account.
So if you follow anyone on Deezer, they will appear on your family profiles.
